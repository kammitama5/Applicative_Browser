- [] Go through tutorial in Rust on [browser engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html)
- [] Read through process of big steps
- [] Break big steps into smaller steps
- [] Look at w3m and lynx
- [] Command Line browser? 
- [] Text box and parsing text
- [] Look at network libraries in Haskell
