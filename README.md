# Applicative_Browser
A long-term project of making a toy browser in Haskell. It will be minimal and render text (8/29/18).

## Goals
- [ ] 1st goal: Have a good sense of how to begin with concrete tasks
- [ ] 2nd goal: Update process to reflect concrete goal

## Process
- TODO
- [ ] try to read through code of a few browsers
- [ ] try to compile a browser (you may need a better machine eg Chrome)
- [ ] diagramming (system, functional, design?)

## Research
- [ ] Go through tutorial in Rust on [browser engine](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html)
- [ ] Read through process of big steps (Layout engine, grammar file, CSS parser, HTML parser, chrome, rendering engine)
- [ ] Break big steps into smaller steps (eg. only parse head of HTML, no divs)
- [ ] Look at w3m and lynx
- [ ] Command Line browser? 
- [ ] Text box and parsing text
- [ ] Look at network libraries in Haskell
- [ ] Error Handling (eg Maybe Haskell, what to expect)
- [ ] Optimization (what tools are usually used? Standardized?)
